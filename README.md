Collection is a Go library that aims to implement basic data structures such as List, Queue, Stack, Heap, and more.

## Supported Data Structures

- [Linked list](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/trviph/collection#List) is implemented as a doubly linked list.
- [Stack](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/trviph/collection#Stack) is implemented by using linked list as the base.
- [Queue](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/trviph/collection#Queue) is implemented by using linked list as the base.
- [Heap](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/trviph/collection#Queue) is implemented by using [slice](https://go.dev/blog/slices-intro) as the base.
